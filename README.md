	A concurrency problem simulation based on the famous “Dining Philosophers Problem”.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Description

The Philosophers project is part of the 42 School curriculum. The goal is to simulate the “Dining Philosophers Problem,” a classic synchronization problem, using multithreading or multiprocessing. Philosophers alternately eat, think, and sleep while avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.

This project provides a deeper understanding of concurrency, thread synchronization, and system-level programming.

Features

	•	Simulates the behavior of philosophers with customizable parameters.
	•	Implements thread synchronization to manage resource sharing (forks).
	•	Avoids deadlocks and race conditions.
	•	Supports two implementations:
	•	Philosophers with threads (mandatory part).
